00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:10.000
What's inside my heart
I have saved to give you
And all the hours that time has to grant me
They are yours until you die

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:20.300
And your story, I don't know
But just tell me what's good
A love so pure that you don't even know the strength it has yet
It's yours and no one else's

I love you in everything, everything, everything
I want more than anything, everything, everything
Love you without limits, live a great story
I love you in everything, everything, everything
I want more than anything, everything, everything
Love you without limits, live a great story

Here or elsewhere
That can be ugly or beautiful
If we are together
There will be a blue sky, oh

A pure love
You don't know how strong you are
My love, I swear
Be yours and no one else's
A pure love

What's inside my heart
I have saved to give you
And all the hours that time has to grant me
They are yours until you die

And your story, I don't know
But just tell me what's good
A love so pure that you don't even know the strength it has yet
It's yours and no one else's

I love you in everything, everything, everything
I want more than anything, everything, everything
Love you without limits, live a great story
I love you in everything, everything, everything
I want more than anything, everything, everything
Love you without limits, live a great story

I love you in everything, everything, everything
I want more than anything
Love you without limits, live a great story
Oh

Love you without limits, live a great story
I love you in everything, everything, everything
I want more than anything, everything, everything
Love you without limits, live a great story
